A simple web application built using React, Express.js, and MongoDB. 

I had no particular productivity ethos in mind while building this other than considering what I personally want in a productivity tool. It's purposefully unfussy and helps me keep my _stuff_ together.

Please give it a try [here](joshcullen.co/joshcullen). I appreciate any and all feedback!
